Lots of marketing papers, like my paper with (Ron Berman)[http://ron-berman.com] on (Profit-Maximizing A/B Tests)[https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2019.1194] describe new methods that can be useful to folks working in marketing as data scientist or analytics pros. But these papers are usually written to convince other professors (the peer reviewers) that the new method is correct and useful. That means that the paper itself is often not very useful to someone who just wants to use the method. So, now that I've convinced the experts that the method is useful, I'm writing this post up for those of you who want to design a test & roll experiment. 

### Why should you use profit-maximizing A/B tests? 
Before we get to the mechanics, we should probably stop for a moment to explain why you might want to run a test and roll experiment (and when you might not).  

### How do you compute the sample size? 

### What if the sample sizes are different? 

### What about those priors?
