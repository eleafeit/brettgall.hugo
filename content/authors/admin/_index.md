I develop data analyis methods to inform core marketing decisions including planning advertising campaigns and designing new products. Recently, I've focused on the design and analysis of randomized marketing experiments, which can be used to measure advertising incrementality. I've also published research on choice modeling and data fusion. Methodologically, I am Bayesian with skills in MCMC sampling, hierarchical models, missing data and decision theory.  

I've spent most of my career at the boundry between academica and industry, first as a research scientist at [General Motors R&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors#Research_and_development), then as a methodologist at [The Modellers](https://www.hallandpartners.com/the-modellers) and most recently as the as the Executive Director of [Wharton Customer Analytics](https://wcai.wharton.upenn.edu). My favorite question to ask anyone working in marketing analytics is, "What aspect of your customers' experiences with your company would you like to understand better?"

I enjoy teaching marketing analytics at all levels and have developed courses at Drexel in data-driven digital marketing (undergraduate), marketing experiments (masters), and Bayesian and causal inference (PhD). I have also developed several [workshops and online courses](/teaching) on marketing analytics. I also wrote [R for Marketing Research and Analytics](http://r-marketing.r-forge.r-project.org/) with [Chris Chapman](https://research.google/people/ChrisChapman/), which has been translated to Chinese, Japanese and Korean andadapted to Python.
