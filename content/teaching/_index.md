### Is My Advertising Working?
This tutorial explains the differences between holdout experiments, model-based attribution, and media-mix modeling. The tutorial is built around analyzing single (synthetic) data set in different ways with data manipulation and analysis in R.

### Choice Modeling for Marketing in R
Based on Chapter 13 of [Chapman and Feit](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-14436-8), these tutorials explain how conjoint analysis and choice modeling are used to inform product design. They also explain how to use the `mlogit` package in R.

### Stan for Choice Modeling (with Kevin Van Horn)
This tutorial explains how to use the [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) platform to fit hierachical Bayes multinomial logit models in R. Assumes some experitise with MCMC output and choice modeling.

### R for Marketing Research & Analytics (with Chris Chapman)
Chris and I developed a complete set of slides for our book, [R for Marketing Research and Analtyics](http://r-marketing.r-forge.r-project.org/about.html). Slides and code are provides for each chapter and follow the book closely.

### R for Reproducable Research
This tutorial for doctoral students in business explains why you should develop a reproducable workflow for your research and provides an overview of how to use R to automate and document your analysis. If you attend a live tutorial, you get to see me do a live analysis of an A/B experiment on the growth of chicks (the baby bird). This data was  provided to me by [Sue McDonnell](https://www.vet.upenn.edu/people/faculty-clinician-search/SUEMCDONNELL) who taught me a lot about scientific workflow.
